# Feedback Management Tool

The '360 Degree Feedback' is one of the practices in Management 3.0 that teams 
can adopt to share feedback amongst its members. In this practice, each member, 
even the boss, participates by giving and receiving feedback.
  
This activity is great to foster individual and team improvement. But, the 
trickiest part of it is managing and preparing the sessions.  
This tool is built to help teams with that!
