The **360 Degree Feedback** is one of the practices mentioned in [Management 3.0](https://management30.com/). 
Agile teams tend to adopt this practice to share feedback amongst its members. 
In this practice, each member, even the boss, participates by giving and receiving
feedback.

This activity is excellent for fostering individual and team improvement. But 
based on our experience, the trickiest and most time-consuming part of this 
practice is managing and preparing the sessions. 

My colleague, Philippe Bourgau, wrote a blog and shared his feedback on the 360
Feedback Session. You can find the article [here](https://philippe.bourgau.net/feedback-on-360-degrees-feedback-session/)!

Based on that, we decided to build this application to make it easier for teams
to adopt this method!

# How the meeting works

## Before the meeting  
Before holding the meeting, the team manager and members have some tasks to 
perform. 
1. The manager sets a date for the '360 Feedback Session'. 
1. Team members (manager included) privately fill a feedback form.
1. Team members send their feedback forms to the manager.
1. The manager reviews the feedback to ensure that there are no offensive words 
that might raise issues between the team members. 
1. In case anyone wrote offensive words, the manager should request clarification 
and update the text.
