# Feedback Management Tool

The **360 Degree Feedback** is one of the practices mentioned in [Management 3.0](https://management30.com/). 
Agile teams tend to adopt this practice to share feedback amongst its members. 
In this practice, each member, even the boss, participates by giving and receiving
feedback.

This activity is excellent for fostering individual and team improvement. But 
based on our experience, the trickiest and most time-consuming part of this 
practice is managing and preparing the sessions. 

My colleague, Philippe Bourgau, wrote a blog and shared his feedback on the 360
Feedback Session. You can find the article [here](https://philippe.bourgau.net/feedback-on-360-degrees-feedback-session/)!

Based on that, we decided to build this application to make it easier for teams
to adopt this method!
